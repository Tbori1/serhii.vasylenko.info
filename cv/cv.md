Professional Experience
--------------------

Mar 2017 - present
:   __Teamlead in ITCraft__

    I started as a single DevOps engineer on a project, then hired one more engineer, and eventually, we evolved into a team of seven members.\
    Key accomplishments:\
    - Created a team that completed more than 20 successful projects of different sizes;\
    - Increased team reputation and visibility inside the company (increased number of shared projects in the result);\
    - Introduced DevOps as a Service culture (versus "outstaff");\
    - Brought up senior and middle engineers from junior newcomers.

    Challenges:\
    - Keeping the team motivated despite workload level: during overloads and a drawdown;\
    - Justification of investments into continuous learning to company stakeholders;\
    - Transforming of team members' mindset.

Nov 2014 - Sep 2016
:   __CTO of techsupport department in YourServerAdmin__

    My position called CTO but in fact, that was a mix of CTO, BA, and PM.\
    Key accomplishments: improved technical expertise of support team; improved task management and task velocity; increased team size; fostered the change of team mindset to agile thinking.

Jun 2011 - Nov 2014
:   __Support Engineer in YourServerAdmin__

    Grew up from a Level-1 tech support engineer, with responsibility for communication with customers and initial problem analysis, to Level-3 System Administrator responsible for complex technical tasks and daily shift management.
