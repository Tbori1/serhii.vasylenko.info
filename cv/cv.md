About Me
--------------------
I am a team leader and an engineer. I am passionate about team management and technologies, have a broad engineering background, and love developing great people, great teams, and great products.

Certified: AWS Solutions Architect Associate, Terraform Associate.


Professional Experience
--------------------
July - Oct 2020
:   ### Instructor in "Hillel" IT School (part-time)

    I had a class of diverse people with different backgrounds and skillsets: sysadmins from IT, students from the university, and even from retail. There was one common thing — they all wanted to know what DevOps is and how does it work.\
    I taught them how to work inside and with the development team, how to use tools such as Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, and Docker, and how to think DevOps.

    It was a win-win for myself and students: I could get a unique experience and fulfill my long-cherished dream of being a teacher, and my students could gain new jobs or promotions.
    
Mar 2017 – June 2020
:   ### Team leader — "ITCraft"

    My biggest project so far — my team. A skilled and highly-motivated team of engineers that sincerely cares about its work outcomes.

    #### Key accomplishments:

    - Created a team of engineers that completed more than 40 successful projects of different sizes;
    - Team size growth: from 1 to 8;
    - Tripled the number of shared projects with other departments by boosting of department reputation and team visibility within the company;
    - Introduced DevOps as a Service business model in the department;
    - Mentored senior and middle engineers from junior newcomers;
    - Fostered the culture of ownership.

    #### Challenges:

    - Transform team members' mindset towards ownership culture;
    - Keep the team motivated despite workload level: during peaks and drawdowns;
    - Justification of the team’s advantages to the clients on the pre-sales stage.

Nov 2014 – Sep 2016
:   ### CTO of tech support department — "YourServerAdmin"

    I was responsible for the technical processes inside the department and for the research of the new technologies we could implement for our clients. Introduced ITIL practices together with our COO and, what I like the most, could change the way of how our sysadmin's department worked with the development department. The work became more coordinated and more integrated.\
    Also, I managed the projects using practices from PRINCE2 methodology and the Theory of Constraints.

    #### Key accomplishments:
    
    - Improved technical expertise of a support team;
    - Improved task management;
    - Increased team size;
    - Fostered the change of team mindset to Agile thinking.

Jun 2011 – Nov 2014
:   ### Support Engineer — "YourServerAdmin"

    I grew up from a Level-1 tech support engineer (communication with customers and initial problem analysis) to Level-3 System Administrator responsible for complex technical tasks and daily shift management.
