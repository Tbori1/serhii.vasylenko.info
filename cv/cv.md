Professional Experience
--------------------
July 2020 – ongoing (~ Oct 20)
:   ### [Instructor](https://kharkiv.ithillel.ua/coaches/sergey-vasilenko) in Hillel IT School (contract)

    I am doing my best in teaching engineers how to master the DevOps approach, methodology, and tools.
    
Mar 2017 – June 2020
:   ### Teamlead – "ITCraft"

    I started as a DevOps engineer on a project, then hired one more engineer, and eventually, we evolved into a team of seven members.

    #### Key accomplishments:

    - Created a team that completed more than 40 successful projects of different sizes;
    - Increased number of shared projects with other departments by boosting of department reputation and team visibility within the company;
    - Introduced DevOps as a Service business model in the department;
    - Mentored senior and middle engineers from junior newcomers.

    #### Challenges:

    - Transform team members' mindset towards ownership culture;
    - Keep the team motivated despite workload level: during peaks and drawdowns;
    - Justification of the team’s advantages to the clients on the pre-sales stage.

Nov 2014 – Sep 2016
:   ### CTO of tech support department – "YourServerAdmin"

    My position called CTO but in fact, that was a mix of:

    CTO. I was responsible for the processes within my team and for the research of the new technologies we could implement for our clients. Also, I introduced ITIL practices together with our COO. But what I like the most is that I could change the way of how our department worked with the development department. The work became more coordinated and more integrated, and that turned into interesting and successful projects for both departments. 

    Project Manager. Managed the projects using practices from PRINCE2 methodology and Theory of Constraints.

    #### Key accomplishments:
    
    - Improved technical expertise of a support team;
    - Improved task management;
