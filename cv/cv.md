About
--------------------
I am an engineer and a team-lead: I am passionate about technologies, have a broad engineering background, and I fond of team management.

I thrive when developing great people, great teams, and great products. 


Professional Experience
--------------------

Mar 2017 - present
:   ### Teamlead - "ITCraft"

    Started as a DevOps engineer on a project, then hired one more engineer, and eventually, we evolved into a team of seven members.

    #### Key accomplishments:

    - Created a team that completed more than 40 successful projects of different sizes;
    - Increased number of shared projects with other departments by boosting of department reputation and team visibility inside the company;
    - Introduced DevOps as a Service business model in department;
    - Brought up senior and middle engineers from junior newcomers.

    #### Challenges:

    - Transforming of team members' mindset towards process ownership;
    - Keeping the team motivated despite workload level: during overloads and a drawdown;
    - Justification of the teamâ€™s advantages to the clients on the pre-sales stage.

Nov 2014 - Sep 2016
:   ### CTO of tech support department - "YourServerAdmin"

    My position called CTO but in fact, that was a mix of:

    As a chief technologist, I was responsible for the main technical processes inside my team and research of the new technologies we could implement for clients. Also, I implemented ITIL practices together with our COO. But what I like the most is that I could change the way of how our department worked with the development department. The work became more united, more interactive, which turned into interesting and successful projects for both departments. 

    Project Manager. Managed the projects using practices from PRINCE2 methodology and Theory of Constraints.

    #### Key accomplishments:
    
    - Improved technical expertise of support team;
    - Improved task management and task velocity;
    - Increased team size;
    - Fostered the change of team mindset to agile thinking.
