Nov 2014 – Sep 2016
:   ### CTO of tech support department – "YourServerAdmin"

    My position called CTO but in fact, that was a mix of:

    As a chief technologist, I was responsible for the main technical processes within my team and research of the new technologies we could implement for clients. Also, I implemented ITIL practices together with our COO. But what I like the most is that I could change the way of how our department worked with the development department. The work became more united, more interactive, which turned into interesting and successful projects for both departments.
