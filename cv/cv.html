<p>I started as a single DevOps engineer on a project, then hired one more engineer, and eventually, we evolved into a team of seven members.<br />
Key accomplishments:<br />
- Created a team that completed more than 20 successful projects of different sizes;<br />
- Increased team reputation and visibility inside the company (increased number of shared projects in the result);<br />
- Introduced DevOps as a Service culture (versus “outstaff”);<br />
- Brought up senior and middle engineers from junior newcomers.</p>
<p>Challenges:<br />
- Keeping the team motivated despite workload level: during overloads and a drawdown;<br />
- Justification of investments into continuous learning to company stakeholders;<br />
- Transforming of team members’ mindset.</p>
